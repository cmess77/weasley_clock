<h1>Good day! My name is Cameron!</h1>
<p>This is meant to be the first project I upload to GitHub.</p>
<p>It's a quick project, consisting of an Arduino MKR WiFi 1000, an Arduino MKR Motor Carrier, and a stepper motor.</p>
<p>This project got started because of online university, ultimately. I found that, with the risk of some robo-proctor 
invalidating my test because a parent or sibling walks into my room, I needed to tape a sheet of paper to my door, with one side indicating I'm taking a test, and the other indicating I'm available.</p>
<h5p>This admittedly inelegant fix is made much better by my Weasley Clock.</h5>

<p>I was watching Harry Potter (for the 21245th time), when I was reminded of the clock the Weasley family owns, showing where all the Weasley's are at any given moment.</p>
<p> The idea is very straight forward:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use a servo to control a "clock arm" indicating whether I am busy or free, or not home.</li>
	<li>Use an Arduino or RaspberryPi SBC to control said "clock"</li>
	<li>Control the Arduino/RaspberryPi from my phone, allowing for a dynamically updated solution</li>
<p>Hopefully it goes well</p>
